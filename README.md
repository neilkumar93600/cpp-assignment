ASSIGNMENT : 1
PROGRAM 1:
Create a class named 'Rectangle' with two data members- length and breadth and a function to calculate the area which is 'length*breadth'. The class has three constructors which are :
1 - having no parameter - values of both length and breadth are assigned zero.
2 - having two numbers as parameters - the two numbers are assigned as length and breadth respectively.
3 - having one number as parameter - both length and breadth are assigned that number.
Now, create objects of the 'Rectangle' class having none, one and two parameters and print their areas.


PROGRAM 2
Create a class named 'Programming'. While creating an object of the class, if nothing is passed to it, then the message "I love programming languages" should be printed. If some String is passed to it, then in place of "programming languages" the name of that String variable should be printed.
For example, while creating the object if we pass "cpp", then "I love cpp" should be printed.


PROGRAM 3
Create a class to print the area of a square and a rectangle. The class has two functions with the same name but different number of parameters. The function for printing the area of rectangle has two parameters which are its length and breadth respectively while the other function for printing the area of square has one parameter which is the side of the square.

PROGRAM 4
A class has an integer data member 'i' and a function named 'printNum' to print the value of 'i'. Its subclass also has an integer data member 'j' and a function named 'printNum' to print the value of 'j'. Make an object of the subclass and use it to assign a value to 'i' and to 'j'. Now call the function 'printNum' by this object.

PROGRAM  5
Create a class 'Student' with three data members which are name, age and address. The constructor of the class assigns default values to name as "unknown", age as '0' and address as "not available". It has two functions with the same name 'setInfo'. First function has two parameters for name and age and assigns the same whereas the second function takes has three parameters which are assigned to name, age and address respectively. Print the name, age and address of 10 students.
Hint - Use array of objects

assingment 3
1. Write a program to print the area and perimeter of a triangle having sides of 3, 4 and 5 units by creating a class named 'Triangle' with the constructor having the three sides as its parameters.
2. Write a program to print the area of two rectangles having sides (4,5) and (5,8) respectively by creating a class named 'Rectangle' with a function named 'Area' which returns the area. Length and breadth are passed as parameters to its constructor.
3. Write a program to print the area of a rectangle by creating a class named 'Area' taking the values of its length and breadth as parameters of its constructor and having a function named 'returnArea' which returns the area of the rectangle. Length and breadth of the rectangle are entered through keyboard.
4. Print the average of three numbers entered by the user by creating a class named 'Average' having a function to calculate and print the average without creating any object of the Average class.
5. Print the sum, difference and product of two complex numbers by creating a class named 'Complex' with separate functions for each operation whose real and imaginary parts are entered by the user.

assignment 4
1. Reverse an array
2. Sort an array
3. Write a program to find frequency of maximum occurred element.
  Ex: arr = [ 2, 3, 2, 5, 6, 2, 7, 8 , 7, 2, 4]
  Output: element : 2
  Frequency: 4
4. Write program to find sum of two smallest elements in array
5. Write program to find difference between largest and smallest element of array
